Thanks for buying Colorful !


To use any of the post-processing effects, select a Camera object from the hierarchy and go to Component -> Colorful. If you're familiar with Photoshop, Gimp or Paint.Net, you should feel at home.

All these effects require Unity Pro and have been tested on the desktop with Unity 3.5.7+ and Unity 4 (DirectX 11). Most of them *should* work on mobile too (I can't say anything about performances though, post-fx are generally quite expensive on these platforms).

If you have any questions of feedback, feel free to contact me on the forum (look for "Chman"), or drop me an email to thomas.hourdel@gmail.com.
